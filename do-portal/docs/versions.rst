Versioning scheme details
=========================

DO, CP and client applications use the following versioning scheme:
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

* MAJOR is incremented when incompatible API changes are introduced
* MINOR is incremented when functionality is added in a
  backwards-compatible manner
* PATCH version is incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes
